## For Teachers

### How Student Records Are Generated

Student records are automatically compiled from:

2. **Marks** you enter for each assessment
3. **Semester status** controlled by the Director

### When Students See Results

- Students see results as soon as you enter marks
- During "Active" semesters, results show as provisional
- When Director closes a semester, results become final
- Rankings update automatically when marks change

### Best Practices

1. **Enter marks promptly** so students can track progress
2. **Use consistent assessment names** for clarity
3. **Verify marks** before semester closure
4. **Communicate** with students about pending assessments

2. **Verify Sections**: Confirm students are in correct sections
3. **Monitor Completeness**: Check that all subjects have teacher assignments
4. **Handle Transfers**: Update registrations when students change grades/sections

### Troubleshooting

## Common Questions

### Q: Why is my rank different from what I expected?
**A**: Rankings are based on percentage averages across all subjects, not raw scores. This ensures fair comparison even when subjects have different assessment structures.

### Q: Can I see results from previous years?
**A**: Yes! The grade selection screen shows all grades you've attended. Click on any grade to see its semesters.

### Q: What does "Provisional" mean?
**A**: During an active semester, results are provisional because teachers may still be entering marks or making corrections.

### Q: Why don't I see all my subjects?
**A**: Only subjects with entered marks or created assessments appear. Contact your teachers if you're missing expected subjects.

### Q: How often are rankings updated?
**A**: Rankings are cached for 5 minutes for performance. They update automatically when marks change.

### Q: Can I export my report card?
**A**: Currently, you can view and print from your browser. PDF export functionality is planned for a future update.
